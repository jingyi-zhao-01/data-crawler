## 🔧 Next Steps for Full Operation

### 1. Configure API Keys (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your API keys:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (for advanced content extraction)
# - FRED_API_KEY (for Federal Reserve economic data)
# - EMAIL credentials (for alert notifications)
```

### 2. Set Up Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Option A: Continuous monitoring
MONITOR_MODE=continuous MONITOR_INTERVAL=30 python run.py

# Option B: Scheduled monitoring (different frequencies for different data)
MONITOR_MODE=scheduled python run.py
```

### 3. Configure Alert Thresholds
Edit `.env` file to customize alert sensitivity:
```bash
GPU_PRICE_SPIKE_THRESHOLD=15      # 15% price increase
TREASURY_YIELD_SPIKE_THRESHOLD=20 # 20 basis points change
NATURAL_GAS_SPIKE_THRESHOLD=10    # 10% price change
```

## 📈 Monitoring Frequencies

The system is configured with intelligent collection frequencies:

| Data Type | Frequency | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **GPU Pricing** | 15 minutes | High volatility, direct revenue impact |
| **Financial Markets** | 15 minutes | Market hours volatility |
| **News & Events** | 1 hour | Breaking news impact |
| **SEC Filings** | 4 hours | Low frequency, high importance |
| **Alert Monitoring** | 30 minutes | Timely notification balance |

## 🎯 Key Correlations Being Tracked

### Primary Profitability Indicators
1. **GPU Pricing vs Energy Costs** - Direct operational impact
2. **Interest Rates vs GPU Demand** - Customer financing effects
3. **Treasury Yields vs Borrowing Costs** - Corporate financing impact
4. **Supply Constraints vs Pricing Power** - Market dynamics

### Risk Factors Monitored
- ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**: Natural gas price spikes (direct cost impact)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**: Interest rate changes (demand/financing)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**: GPU supply constraints (availability)
- ⚠️ **LOW RISK**: Treasury yield fluctuations (cost of capital)
